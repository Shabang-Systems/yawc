....for mobile!

This is an React Native app using Expo. It should behave like one. It is *only a mobile app* (web support is limited and probably broken).

** A Good Time

#+begin_src bash
yarn ios
#+end_src

or

#+begin_src bash
yarn android
#+end_src

No keys/secrets required apart from your own wandb key. Have fun!
