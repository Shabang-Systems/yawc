# YetAnotherWandbClient
Have you every had the situation where you are on a run, and you suddenly get raked with guilt that your run may have crashed, so you open WandB only to find that the clunky mobile web interface doesn't allow you to zoom into the part of the loss graph you want? No? Just me?

Well, in response, we introduce:

![app preview](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Shabang-Systems/yawc/master/assets/banner.jpeg?raw=true)

This is an React Native app using Expo which solves the above-mentioned certainly very frequent problem that normal people have. It should behave like one if you want to help develop it. If you don't know how one works, [read about it](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/tools/). It is **only a mobile app** (web support is limited and probably broken).

## A Good Time
```bash
yarn ios
```

or

```bash
yarn android
```

No keys/secrets required apart from your own wandb key. Have fun!
