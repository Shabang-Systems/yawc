# YetAnotherWandbClient
....for mobile!

This is an React Native app using Expo. It should behave like one. It is **only a mobile app** (web support is limited and probably broken).

## A Good Time
```bash
yarn ios
```

or

```bash
yarn android
```

No keys/secrets required apart from your own wandb key. Have fun!
